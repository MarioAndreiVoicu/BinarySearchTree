# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation
Templated Binary Search Tree Implementation in C++
This is a templated binary search tree implementation in C++ that can hold any primitive data type. A binary search tree is a data structure used for efficient searching, insertion, deletion, and traversal in a sorted order.

Functions: <br>
* Insert: inserts a new node with the given key into the binary search tree <br><br>
* Delete: deletes the node with the given key from the binary search tree <br><br>
* Erase: erases a node from the binary search tree <br><br>
* Construct Tree : constructs a binary search tree from the given vector of keys <br><br>
* Max: finds and returns the node with the maximum key value starting from the given node. <br><br>
* Min: finds and returns the node with the minimum key value starting from the given node. <br><br>
* Successor: finds and returns the node with the successor key value of the given node <br><br>
* Predecessor: finds and returns the node with the predecessor key value of the given node <br><br>
* Find: finds and returns the node with the given key <br><br>
* Display InOrder: displays the nodes of the binary search tree in InOrder traversal <br><br>
* Display PreOrder: displays the nodes of the binary search tree in PreOrder traversal <br><br>
* Display PostOrder: displays the nodes of the binary search tree in PostOrder traversal<br><br>
* Display LevelOrder: displays the nodes of the binary search tree in LevelOrder traversal <br><br>
* Empty: checks if the binary search tree is empty <br><br>
* Clear: clears all the nodes in the binary search tree <br><br>

A menu has been implemented to test the Binary Search Tree,which allows testing of all the functions mentioned above
